# Configurable Signature Template
 
This Zimlet allows the SysAdmin to provision a template for the signature for the users in a company. In a template a number of fields are defined, for example name, function and comments. When the user clicks the Zimlet that fields can be filled and the new signature is generated (with preview).

- Modify the template for your company
- Zip the contents of com_zimbra_signature_zimlet folder (do not include the folder)
- Deploy on your server

We can also modify it for you or you can make donations via:
